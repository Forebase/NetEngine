# NetEngine
## Your internet, your control.

NetEngine is a declarative platform for bootstrapping self-contained, authority-autonomous digital worlds. Give it a YAML spec and it provisions authoritative DNS, a private PKI/ACME CA, OIDC identity (Keycloak), network isolation (nftables), domain and world registries, mail, storage, and org applications — all running in Docker on a single host.

---

## What it does

A *world* is a self-contained internet: its own TLD hierarchy, its own certificate authority, its own identity provider, and its own network policies. NetEngine turns a YAML spec into a live world in under ten minutes.

```
netengine up examples/minimal.yaml
```

That single command runs nine phases in sequence:

| Phase | What it provisions |
|---|---|
| 0 — Substrate | Docker networks, NTP, orchestrator init |
| 1–2 — DNS | CoreDNS root + platform zones, TLD hierarchy |
| 3 — PKI | step-ca root CA + ACME endpoint |
| 4 — Platform identity | Keycloak realm, admin user, platform OIDC client |
| 5 — Registries | World registry, domain registry, WHOIS server |
| 6 — In-world identity | Per-org Keycloak realms |
| 7 — ANDs | Administrative Network Domains (nftables isolation) |
| 8 — Services | Postfix, MinIO |
| 9 — Org applications | Org app deployments |

Each phase is idempotent — re-running `netengine up` skips already-completed phases.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.13+**
- **Docker** (Engine 24+, Compose optional)
- **PostgreSQL 15+** with the [pgmq](https://github.com/tembo-io/pgmq) extension — the easiest way is `docker compose up -d db` using the included `docker-compose.yml`
- **Poetry** (`pip install poetry`)

---

## Quickstart

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/Forebase/NetEngine.git
cd NetEngine

# 2. Install dependencies
poetry install

# 3. Verify host prerequisites
poetry run netengine doctor

# 4. Start local Postgres + pgmq (includes pgmq extension pre-installed)
docker compose up -d postgres

# 5. Apply migrations
poetry run python -m netengine.utils.run_migrations

# 6. Boot a minimal world
poetry run netengine up examples/minimal.yaml
```

If you only want host/container checks before configuring Postgres, run `poetry run netengine doctor --skip-db`. Check status at any time:

```bash
poetry run netengine status
```

Tear down:

```bash
poetry run netengine down
```

---

## Configuration

Worlds are defined in YAML. See `examples/` for reference:

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `examples/minimal.yaml` | Bare minimum — no orgs, no ANDs, services off |
| `examples/single-org.yaml` | One organisation with residential AND |
| `examples/dev-sandbox.yaml` | Full dev setup with orgs, ANDs, mail, storage |

See [`docs/alpha-quickstart.md`](docs/alpha-quickstart.md) for alpha golden paths, acceptance checks, and troubleshooting-oriented setup details.

### Spec composition

Large specs can be split across files:

```bash
# Base + environment overlay
poetry run netengine up examples/spec.base.yaml --env dev

# Inline override
poetry run netengine up spec.yaml --set metadata.name=my-world
```

### Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `NETENGINE_DB_URL` | `postgresql://netengine:dev_password@localhost:5432/netengine` | Local Postgres connection string |
| `SUPABASE_URL` + `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` | — | Set both to use Supabase cloud instead of local Postgres |
| `NETENGINE_STATE_FILE` | `netengines_state.json` | Path to runtime state JSON |
| `NETENGINE_MOCK` | `false` | Set `true` to skip real Docker/DNS/PKI calls (useful for CI) |
| `NETENGINE_ZONE_DIR` | `./data/coredns` | Directory for CoreDNS zone files |

---

## Alpha operations and security

Deeper operational guidance has moved into the alpha docs:

- [`docs/operator-guide.md`](docs/operator-guide.md) for lifecycle commands, operator API examples, imports/exports, and migrations.
- [`docs/security-model.md`](docs/security-model.md) for secrets handling, redaction, and destructive-action safeguards.
- [`docs/state-and-backups.md`](docs/state-and-backups.md) for runtime state, support bundles, and backup/restore guidance.
- [`docs/troubleshooting.md`](docs/troubleshooting.md) for common failures and recovery procedures.

```

**Runtime state** is persisted to `netengines_state.json` after each phase so interrupted runs can resume where they left off. The state file carries `schema_version: netengine.runtime_state.v1`; pre-version alpha.1 state files are detected as v1-compatible and stamped on the next save, while unknown future/foreign versions fail closed with instructions to export using the older release or migrate through a compatible release. The file is written atomically with `0600` permissions because it can contain runtime secrets (bootstrap admin password, OIDC client secrets, generated in-world admin passwords, and other phase outputs). Do not commit it, attach it to issues, or copy it into shared logs; use a sanitized support bundle instead.

**Spec compatibility** is tracked in `metadata.schema_version` (default `netengine.spec.v1`). The loader accepts missing schema versions for existing alpha specs, rejects unsupported versions before boot/import, and includes the spec schema in support bundles so alpha.2+ can decide whether an alpha.1 world is safe to restore.

**Support bundles** are produced with `netengine export --out netengine-support-bundle.json` or `GET /api/v1/export`. Bundles include schema metadata, the world spec, phase completion, public CA material, and sanitized phase outputs with secret-looking fields/private PEMs removed. NetEngine uses the Sober-Co [`redactable`](https://github.com/Sober-Co/redactable) package for redaction when it is installed (with a local alpha fallback until it is available on PyPI). Restore with `netengine import <bundle-file>` or `POST /api/v1/import`; import validates the bundle schema, spec schema compatibility, spec parseability, known phases, phase prerequisites, and required outputs before replacing local runtime state.

**Persistent teardown safety** requires typed confirmation. CLI teardown of a persistent world must pass `netengine down --confirm <world-name>`; the operator API requires both `confirm=true` and `confirmation` equal to the world name. `--yes` is intentionally not enough for persistent destructive operations.

**Events** flow phase-to-phase via pgmq queues defined by `netengine/events/queues.py::PRIMARY_QUEUES`. There are currently 11 primary queues (`dns_updates`, `oidc_provisioning`, `and_provisioning`, `inworld_admissions`, `services_admissions`, `and_admissions`, `pki_cert_rotation_events`, `drift_events`, `world_health`, `gateway_portal_events`, `phase_events`) plus 11 matching dead-letter queues (`*_dlq`) for failed messages.

## Operator API

When a world is running, the FastAPI operator API is available at `https://api.platform.internal:8080`. The supported alpha surface is versioned under `/api/v1`; interactive OpenAPI documentation is served at `/docs`, and the raw OpenAPI document is available at `/openapi.json`.

See [`docs/operator-guide.md`](docs/operator-guide.md) for authentication, route coverage, curl examples, import/export, queue operations, and teardown confirmation details.

## Roadmap to v1

The active development roadmap lives in the [GitHub project](https://github.com/Forebase/NetEngine). Key items:

- [x] End-to-end integration test (real Docker, live DNS query, cert issuance, OIDC login)
- [x] Complete operator API (org CRUD, AND management, domain management)
- [x] Cross-world federation
- [x] `persistent` lifecycle mode (import/export, lifecycle guards, teardown confirmation)
- [x] `netengine down --dry-run`
